# GatorGather
A platform for social and academic interaction at the University of Florida.

## Our Mission
GatorGather is a web-based student networking application designed to
address a critical gap in the University of Florida student experience: the
difficulty many students face in forming meaningful social and academic
connections. This issue is especially prevalent among students who did not
arrive with a pre-existing social network. We want to facilitate bringing
together people who want to study for a class, get involved in a club, or
just meet like-minded peers. In this way, we can foster a greater sense of
community on campus. Unlike broader social platforms, GatorGather is
specialized for the UF experience—it emphasizes much more local interaction
and student-led engagement, which are often lost in more general networking
apps. The name “GatorGather” reflects this goal: a place where Gators gather
—for academics, friendship, and shared experiences that define life at the
University of Florida.
